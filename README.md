# DNPERF - ALPHA
## List of changes
- Port some functions of d3dx9math to DXMATH (can be compiled with AVX/AVX2/AVX512)
- Ice stacks attaches only once. (Damage is still the same, but I might find an alternative without affect the visuals)
- Reduce Low Frag Heap. (on testing)
- Removed a lot of Critical Sections. (on testing)

## CPU Architecture
Check your cpu on techpowerup/intel/amd website to see if your cpu is supported for specific instruction such as AVX, AVX2 or AVX512.
